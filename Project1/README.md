This project involves the design and simulation of a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) using 0.18Î¼m CMOS technology in Keysight ADS (Advanced Design System).
The design focuses on optimizing phase noise, tuning range, and power consumption for RF applications.
Project Description, My Report and ADS files are provided.
