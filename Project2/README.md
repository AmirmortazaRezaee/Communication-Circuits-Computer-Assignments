This project presents the design and simulation of a Source-Inductively Degenerated (SID) Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA) in 0.18Î¼m CMOS technology using Keysight ADS.
The design optimizes noise figure (NF), gain, and input matching at 2.45GHz for RF front-end applications.
Project Description, My Report and ADS files are provided.
